# Pico2W DualSense 5 Bridge

[中文](./README.CN.md)

> Turn a Raspberry Pi Pico2W into a wireless adapter for the DualSense (DS5) controller.

## Overview

This project enables the Raspberry Pi Pico2W to function as a Bluetooth bridge for the DualSense controller, allowing wireless connectivity with enhanced haptics support.

## Features

- 🎮 Full DualSense connectivity via Pico2W
- 🔊 Supports HD haptics (advanced vibration feedback)
- 📡 Wireless Bluetooth bridging
- 🔄 Multi-platform mode switching (DS5 / DSE / Switch)
- ⚙️ Adjustable haptic gain via microphone volume
- 🔕 Configurable LED and disconnection behaviors

## Combo Key Mode Switching

While the DS5 controller is connected via Bluetooth, hold the following button combinations for **3 seconds** to switch modes (auto-saves to flash and reconnects USB):

| Combo | Target Mode |
|-------|-------------|
| PS + Options + D-pad Up | DS5 mode |
| PS + Options + D-pad Right | DSE mode |
| PS + Options + D-pad Left | Switch mode |

## Getting Started

### Get the firmware

You have two options:

- **Download a pre-built `.uf2`** — grab the newest
  [Releases](../../releases) build (`ds5-bridge-*.uf2`). No tools needed.
- **Build it yourself** — see [Build Instructions](#build-instructions)
  below (Windows users get a one-command script).

### Flashing Firmware

1. Hold the BOOTSEL button on the Pico2W
2. Connect the Pico2W to your computer via USB
3. The device will mount as a USB storage device
4. Drag and drop the .uf2 firmware file onto the device

### Pairing the Controller

1. Put the DualSense controller into Bluetooth pairing mode
2. Wait for the Pico2W to detect and connect
3. Once connected, the device will appear on the host system

***You may need to replug the Pico when the controller is in pairing mode.***

## Configuration

You can modify the Pico settings via the web config.

- For release: https://ds5.awalol.eu.org
- For development: https://ds5-dev.awalol.eu.org

## Notes

The Pico device will only be visible to the system after the controller is connected

Some behaviors depend on reconnection cycles to take effect

### Low-battery LED indicator

When the connected DualSense reports its battery at or below 10% (and it is not charging), the Pico onboard LED switches from solid-on to a 1 Hz blink so you can see the warning at a glance. The LED returns to solid-on as soon as the controller is plugged in or its reported level rises again. The blink also fires when `disable_pico_led` is set — the warning is treated as critical and overrides the LED-off preference; the LED returns to its disabled (off) state once the battery recovers or the controller starts charging.

To opt out at build time, configure with `-DENABLE_BATT_LED=OFF`. Default is ON.

### Pico W Version

Pico W only has haptics support, no speaker. You can enable Pico W firmware compilation with `-DPICO_W_BUILD=ON`, or download precompiled firmware from GitHub Actions.

### USB Wake Feature

This feature is experimental. If you need this functionality, please check out the feat/usb-wake branch to compile it, or use the precompiled firmware from GitHub Actions under that branch. The `ds5-bridge-wake.uf2` is the firmware with this feature enabled.

It is recommended to read #60 and #61 before using this feature.

### Community Fork
https://github.com/MarcelineVPQ/DS5Dongle-OLED-Edition
https://github.com/zurce/DS5Dongle-OLED

## Known Issues

- ⚠️ Audio may experience slight stuttering
- ⚠️ Overclocking is required for proper performance

## Performance / Overclocking

Due to encoding requirements, the Pico2W must be overclocked:

Current settings:

- Voltage: 1.2V
- Frequency: 320 MHz

If your device fails to boot:

- Increase voltage slightly or Reduce CPU frequency

## Build Instructions

### Windows 11 (one command, no WSL)

You don't even need to clone this repo. Download just
[`tools/build-windows.ps1`](tools/build-windows.ps1) to any folder and run
it in **PowerShell**:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-windows.ps1
```

(If you already have a checkout, run `tools\build-windows.ps1` from the
repo root instead — it detects and uses your local checkout.)

The script installs every prerequisite (CMake, Ninja, Python, Git and the
ARM GNU toolchain — via `winget`, falling back to portable downloads if
`winget` is unavailable), clones the project (if not run from a checkout)
plus the pinned Pico SDK + TinyUSB into `%USERPROFILE%\.ds5-build`, builds
the firmware, and drops `ds5-bridge.uf2` next to the script and on your
Desktop. It is safe to re-run; already-installed tools are skipped.

Build a fork or a specific ref with `-Repo <url>` / `-Ref <branch|tag>`.

Build a variant with `-Variant debug` or `-Variant wake`.

### Other platforms

To build from source manually:

1. Install the Pico SDK 2.2.0 and switch its TinyUSB submodule to tag 0.20.0
i.e. ***Update TinyUSB in the Pico SDK to the latest version***
2. Initialise this repo's submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Configure and build with the standard Pico SDK toolchain:
   `cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPICO_SDK_PATH=<sdk>`
   then `cmake --build build --target ds5-bridge`

1. ***Update TinyUSB in the Pico SDK to the latest version***
2. Compile using standard Pico SDK toolchain

### Web Config Tool

The web config tool lets you adjust controller mode, polling rate, haptic gain, LED behavior and more — right from your browser via WebHID.

> **Browser requirement:** Chrome or Edge (WebHID is not supported in Firefox/Safari). Must be served over HTTPS or `localhost`.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd ds5dongle-config-web
npm install

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in Chrome/Edge, then:

1. Click **Connect** and select the DS5 Bridge device from the popup
2. Adjust settings as needed — changes are saved to the dongle's flash

To build for deployment:

```bash
npm run build    # output in ds5dongle-config-web/dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build locally
```
